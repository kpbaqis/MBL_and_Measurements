# MBL_and_Measurements
Python code used to produce and visualise data for axiv:2307.12064

The code is broken into two files:
1/ data_script.py produces the simulation data and store the resulting densiy matrices along with the imbalance
2/ plot_script.py contains post processing to produce other quantities of interest using the density matrices, and then plots the final result

All simulations utilize QuTiP v5, the manual can be found at https://qutip.readthedocs.io/en/master/ and installation of v5 is complete using "pip install --pre qutip"
